# Rapid Photo Downloader

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

Rapid Photo Downloader is a Linux desktop application that imports photos 
and videos from cameras, phones, memory cards, and other devices at high 
speed. It is written by a [photographer](https://damonlynch.net) for 
professional and amateur photographers.

## Personal Note From the Developer

This project has only ever had one software developer. I developed a hand 
injury from typing while working on the code in early 2022. As such code
development has slowed considerably as I seek to recover from this serious 
injury. To work around the injury, I am using the JetBrains editor PyCharm 
in conjunction with the voice recognition tools Talon and Dragon 
NaturallySpeaking on Windows / WSL2. While this  notably restricts my 
ability to test the code, at least I can write it.

I want to thank JetBrains for allowing me to use PyCharm Professional For 
free under their [open source developer program](https://www.jetbrains.com/community/opensource/#support). 

## Depreciation of the Install Script

I cannot maintain the `install.py` script due to my hand injury (see above)
&mdash; testing the script in the variety of Linux distributions it supports
requires a lot of typing. The script is therefore depreciated and I do not 
recommend its use, especially on recent Linux distributions.


## User Survey 

If you have any experience with Rapid Photo Downloader at all, including if 
you no longer use it, please join hundreds of others by taking this survey: 

[Survey of past, current, and potential users](https://survey.rapidphotodownloader.com/)

The responses are already making a real difference to the programâ€™s future 
development. The program collects no analytics whatsoever, so a survey like 
this is truly helpful. Thank you in advance.

## Documentation

[Full documentation is available at the program website](https://damonlynch.net/rapid/documentation/).


## Program Design

Rapid Photo Downloader is coded in Python. To get the best performance using 
Python on modern multi-core computers, the program uses multiple OS-level 
processes that communicate with each other using the messaging library 
[0MQ](https://zeromq.org/).

## Installation

Rapid Photo Downloader is packaged by all major Linux distributions.

If you want the latest version, or prefer it run with all its features enabled 
(like [heif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format)
support), you can run the `install.py` script, which downloads and installs the
latest version. 

To use the script to install Rapid Photo Downloader, run as your regular user 
(i.e. without sudo):

```bash
  python3 install.py
```

This script will install packages from your Linux distribution and from the 
[Python Package Index (PyPi)](https://pypi.org/).
The program sudo may prompt for your administrator (root) password during 
the install process, if required.

For a list of optional commands you can give the installer, run:

```bash
  python3 install.py --help
```

Finally, to uninstall:

```bash
  python3 install.py --uninstall
```

Or to uninstall both the program and its Python package dependencies:

```bash
  python3 install.py --uninstall-including-pip-dependencies
```

### Installation into a Python Virtual Environment

Rapid Photo Downloader can be installed into a virtual environment,
allowing you to isolate the Python packages it needs from other programs
on your system.

Virtual environments created with the `--system-site-packages` option are
not supported. An Intel or AMD 64 bit platform is required.

To install Rapid Photo Downloader into a Python virtual environment,
create the virtual environment (naming it whatever you like):

```bash
  python3 -m venv myenv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

```bash
  source myenv/bin/activate
```

Then run the installer, passing the command line option telling the
script to install Rapid Photo Downloader into the virtual environment:

```bash
  python install.py --virtual-env
```

Once installed, you can then deactivate the virtual
environment with the deactivate command:

```bash
  deactivate
```

Rapid Photo Downloader can be started without activating the virtual
environment by running

```bash
  myenv/bin/rapid-photo-downloader
```

To uninstall from the virtual environment, simply delete the virtual
environment\'s directory.
